 ## Bubble Sort
  This Sorting algorithm has O(n^2) time complexity.
  ### Algorithm for Bubble sort
      -> first iterate though a given array(i as a looping variable) 
        ->secondly run a second nested loop (j as a looping variable)
          -> check(arr[j]>=arr[j+1]) then swap(arr[j],arr[j+1])
