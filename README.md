 ## Bubble Sort
  This Sorting algorithm has O(n^2) time complexity.
  ### Algorithm for Bubble sort
      -> first iterate though a given array(i as a looping variable) 
        ->secondly run a second nested loop (j as a looping variable)
          -> check(arr[j]>=arr[j+1]) then swap(arr[j],arr[j+1])
 ## Insertion Sort
  This Sorting algorithm has O(n^2) time complexity.
  ### Algorithm for Insertion sort
       In this sorting we basically make a gap such that the smallest element to the adjacent will occupy that place:
       1.
             for example:  6->5->7->3->2
             for i=1: first=5
             while(A[j]>=5) we make a gap in the 1st place i.e. 6 so 6->5 will become 5->6
       Similarly this process go on:
